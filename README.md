# LLM Data Visualization Pipeline

This project allows users to upload CSV datasets, convert them into a standardized JSON format with metadata, and then use that JSON as input to an LLM-driven pipeline for data exploration and visualization.

## Goals

- Upload CSV → standardized JSON with metadata
- Store dataset and metadata with a `dataset_id`
- Use LLM to suggest questions and generate visualization specs
- Document experiments in Jupyter notebooks (exportable to PDF)
